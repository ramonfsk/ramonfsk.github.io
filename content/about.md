Hi, I'm Ramon Ferreira and I've been on the internet for a long time. Nowadays I have a degree in Computer Science and Software Engineer in a fintech company in Brazil (*I have over ten years working in technology*).

In the past I have participated a lot in forums and written in some blogs about different subjects, but mostly about technology and anime.

I created this blog with the intention of writing about things I like and trying to evolve as a writer and communicator, I hope that one day I will achieve this goal. 😂

If you want to get in touch, fell free to send a [email](mailto:ramonfsk@gmail.com) for me, when I have time I will read it, I promise.

Bye, have a good time! ✌🏻
